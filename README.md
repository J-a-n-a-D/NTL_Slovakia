Mapping economic activity from outer space


DESCRIPTION:

This thesis script aims to investigate the relationship between night time light intensity from satellite images and various economic performance indicators for the Slovak Republic. To achieve this, night time light index was calibrated for the area of Slovakia from 2004 to 2022. This index was then analyzed at the trend level, immediate impact, and influence of historic data using Pearson correlation, Linear regression, Vector Autoregression, and Vector Error Correction Mechanism. This approach targets to explore the potential of night time lights as a more evidence-based policymaking tool, offering a precise and low-cost alternative to traditional economic measurement approaches.The analysis also highlighted capabilities of detecting urbanization patterns and extensive infrastructure networks by night time lights visualization, offering new insights into regional disparities and the socioeconomic distribution of wealth. This approach suggests practical applications for policymakers, including the use of this alternative measurement in forecasting, monitoring of policy effects or creating more informed policy decisions targeted at reduction of inequality at both national and sub-national levels.


SETUP:

Required Python libraries: numpy, rasterio, geopandas, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, scipy, statsmodels

DATA: 

For running the code it is necesarry to download the satellite images stored in cloud and coordination for Slovakia

The satellite images are used from the article + Data source and Coordination for Slovakia (NUTS 1 [State level] and NUTS 3 [Region level]):
